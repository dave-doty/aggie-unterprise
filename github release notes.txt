When you want to publish the package to PyPi, make sure to bump the version, then add a new GitHub release named v{version}, e.g., v1.0.1.

If something goes wrong with GitHub actions and you want to try again with the same version number, delete both the GitHub release AND the tag that it created (click on "Tags" at the top of the releases page).
